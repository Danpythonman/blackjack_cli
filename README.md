Introduction
============

This program includes an object-oriented representation of a deck of cards,
along with the game of Blackjack played through the command line, using the deck of cards.
The entire program is implemented in C++.

Also included is a C++ program for testing the deck of cards.

This originally started as a final project for the LinkedIn Learning course "C++ Essential Training" by Bill Weinman. The final project was to create a deck of cards in C++. I decided to extend the project and use the deck of cards I created to implement the game of Blackjack.


Requirements
============

To compile and run the program, you must have a C++ compiler, like g++.

This program uses the following libraries:

* `iostream`
* `fstream`
* `string`
* `vector`
* `cstdio`
* `cstdlib`
* `ctime`

If on Windows, the `windows.h` library is included. Otherwise, the `unistd.h` library is included instead.


Installation
============

Download this repository and compile and run the program.

To compile the Blackjack game:

```
g++ deck.cpp blackjack.cpp -o blackjack.out
```

Then run the output file.

```
blackjack.out
```


Configuration
==============

This module has no menu or modifiable settings.
